            <h2>Our History</h2>

Initially hosted in a university lecture hall, our focus on ethical technology quickly resonated with the wider industry. Over the years, TechCon has grown into an international event, becoming the essential platform for launching groundbreaking ideas and fostering global tech partnerships.
